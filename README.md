# Car-Sale-Dashboard-Using-Tableau

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement 1:
KPI’s Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
1.	Sales Overview:
•	Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
•	Year-over-year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
2.	Average Price Analysis:
•	YTD Average Price
•	YOY Growth in Average Price
3.	Cars Sold Metrics:
•	YTD Cars Sold
•	YOY Growth in Cars Sold

## Problem Statement 2:
Charts Requirement

1.	YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
2.	YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
3.	YTD Total Sales by Color: Present the contribution of various car colours to the YTD total sales through a doughnut chart.
4.	YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
5.	Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
